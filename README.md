# Django-Park-Automobile
Application Web with Django 


# The purpose of the application is:


Vehicle management (Addition, Modification, Deletion and Consultation)
Driver management (Addition, Modification, Deletion and Consultation)
Moped management (Add, Modify, Delete and View)
The management of fuel allocations for vehicles (endowments that are given to the
driver of a vehicle monthly spread over several acquisitions)
The management of the endowments for mopeds (endowments that are given to the driver a moped monthly)
Mission management for drivers
Repair management
Waste management
Possibilities to consult situations concerning the managed elements.

#N.B.
The monthly allowance for a vehicle or moped is capped; so the goal here
is to monitor and control the allocations given to each vehicle and moped.
The most important thing in the part of the fuel allocations is that the amounts entered
must be paralleled in another situation that can be consulted or printed
by date or by vehicle or overall status.
